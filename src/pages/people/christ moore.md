Associate Professor Christopher Moore is a researcher, teacher, and maker of things. He received his MFA in Communication Design from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design before joining Simon Fraser University’s School of Interactive Arts and Technology in 1999. From 2004 to 2008, he was an Assistant Professor in the Department of New Media at the University of Lethbridge, holding the title of Acting Chair during his final year. Moore’s multidisciplinary research and teaching interests include vernacular design and popular culture, experimental typography, and the use of humour as a form of social resistance. He has participated in artist residencies throughout North America, and his recent bodies of sculpture and media-based installations have been featured in both solo and group exhibitions across Canada and abroad. Moore’s current Speculative Play project with Rilla Khaled and Pippin Barr focuses on designing our way out of the present and reimagining future scenarios.
