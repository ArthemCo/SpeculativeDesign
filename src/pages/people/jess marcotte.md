Jessica Rose Marcotte is a game designer, writer, intersectional feminist, and PhD student at Concordia University who has worked on games such as “In Tune: a game about navigating consent” and “Seventy-Eight: attitudes towards women in the workplace.” Through these projects, they explores their interests in accessibility, diversity and provoking meaningful conversations through their work. Their other research interests include critical and speculative design, feminist making, and praxis-focused research. Their PhD at TAG, under the supervision of Rilla Khaled, will explore how humans make connections to artificial personalities and intelligences such as Non-Playable Characters through a research-creation approach. They are a founding member of Tweed Couch Games and were one of the co-directors for Critical Hit 2015. In their spare time, they like to scuba dive, make sushi and play roleplaying and board games. They maintain a blog about their game-making practice at tag.hexagram.ca/jekagames.
