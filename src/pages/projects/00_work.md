The robots are here! No more work! It’s great! Is it great?! Wait! You feel apathetic and unproductive! You miss clicking buttons! You miss waiting for progress bars! You miss checkboxes! You miss work! But it’s going to be okay! Use this handy application and it is as if you were doing work!

It is as if you were doing work is a game set in a near future in which robot and software labour has led to mass unemployment for humans. In this new reality, humans are largely expected to live in leisure or exercising their creativity, but there is an issue around a sense of worth and productivity that needs to be addressed. This software addresses that need through the creation of a simulation of conventional “computer work” that might be imagined in an office setting. The user is able to type up documents and emails and interact with conventional user-interface elements under instructions from the computer in order to win “work points” and promotions. This simulated work is intended to provide the validation of work in a workless world.
