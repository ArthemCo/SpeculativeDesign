The DRIFT workshop was held at the TAG lab between 20 – 24 June 2016. The workshop was the Montréal satellite edition of a larger project between TAG and London-based artist duo Jorge Lopes Ramos and Persis Jade Maravala of ZU-UK. The core brief was to make games and playful experiences based loosely around a scene from the Georg Büchner play Woyzeck combined with a focusing on the setting of a dinner date.

In the TAG satellite edition, the Speculative Play team ran the workshop with a particular slant toward concerns around mental health and relationships, with many of the artefacts produced including a focus on speculative imaginings of therapy, social encounters, and the role of technology in mediating these human experiences.
