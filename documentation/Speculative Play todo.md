## Odd ideas
The rooms are museum-like, but it needn't be that way. Some of the decor could be altered so that this was a speculative mansion, instead of a speculative museum. The museum is more apt in terms of storage for now-finished things for the public to see, but a mansion / or fancy home may be more inviting (and playful).
