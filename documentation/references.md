## Games
- [Coloratura](http://www.maderealstories.com/games/Coloratura-twine.html) | Lynnea Glasser, 2013 <br>
 "The Song of the Universe envelops you, pulsing through you in the otherworldly aether. You sing, sing, sing the song of ancients, of the unending, of all to come and be. Your semi-aqueous body kneads upon itself, in time to the rhythm: Spread, then fold, spread, then fold. The Universe echoes infinitely your leitmotif: Erupt, engulf, erupt, engulf." [Design notes](http://blog.maderealstories.com/2013/07/coloratura.html)
- [ESC](https://radicaldreamland.itch.io/esc) | Radican Dream Land (Lena Raine), 2018 <br>
  "ESC emulates roleplaying in the text-based multi-user dungeons (MUDs) that became possible in the late 1970s and 1980s as computers became networked. Part of ESC is firmly planted in this history. Everything about ESC's audio and visuals–from the glitched 1-bit texture startup screen to the simulated CRT flicker to the subtle whrrr-ing and clicks of moving computer parts–evokes a sense of a bygone era of computing."
